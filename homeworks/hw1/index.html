    <p>Hi! I am Junior studying Cognitive science hoping to also get a minor
        in data science a certificate in design.
         Some things about me are that I love to try new foods, 
        Watch TV, and crochet in my free time. Nice to meet you all!

    <h2> Part 2: Reading Responses </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. I learned from this article that there are four things to keep in mind when desigining a website. 
            This includes: Hierarchy, Content, Intent, and Audience. This makes it easier for designers to understand
          how their deisgn will flow to their consumers and what makes a design good. I also learned that design doesn't 
            just mean following what's trending, everything has a purpose and intention behind it. Lastly, I learned that there 
            are different things someone could use to emphasize a different place in the heiarchy like font, placement, and character
             traits (bold/italics/round/sharp).  </li>
        <li>2. My favorite part of the article was when they broke down examples of good design especially within the twitter post. I
            never thought about twitter's design until analyzing it that there was a purpose behind why each text is placed in a 
            certain way and highlighted. It makes me realize something like bold text actually makes an impact on design  </li>
        <li>3. "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
        <li>4. I would rate this article a 7 on the enjoyment scale just because it was short. I know that differnt components of a design 
            will impact how you use it but I think it's important to emphasize other things on websites. What other things should we look for?
            I think there is just more behing purposeful and good utility design, but what about aesthetics? </li>
      </ul>
