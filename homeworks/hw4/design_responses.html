						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of considering color accessibility in digital product design to help those with visual impairments. 
								It highlighted how neglecting color accessibility can exclude users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies from accessing and understanding digital content. 
								The article provided practical tips for ensuring color accessibility, such as testing contrast ratios and avoiding sole reliance on color to convey information, and even gave resources to help beginners on how to test color palletes. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part where they showed us an example from Trello showcasing their colorblind options. 
								I think it is really creative to use patterns with different saturations to showcase different components rather than color. 
								It's great to emphasize this to people who cannot see color at all as it impacts a great part of the population but not many people think about them.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Accessibility in digital product design is the practice of crafting experiences for all people, including those of us with visual, speech, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities. 
								As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web weâ€™re all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give it a 8 out of 10 because I didn't realize the impact of a color palette as I thought it was only an aesthetic choice. 
								I like how this website not only highlighted how important color was but also how to use the resources to apply these ideas in different projects.
