                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Some things I learned about this article is about design principles like simplicity and usability. Most of these websites display a simple UI that is easy to read and follow.
                                It also shows some design principle such as text and color contrasts so it's easily legible for people with vision impairments. I think it shows all the components of design that we learned so far.  
                                 </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is looking at all the unique designs for different websites. There are many cool animation aspects that enhance the user experience as it makes interacting with the website fun. 
                                I particularly like Dark by 𝔅𝔢𝔰𝔱𝔖𝔢𝔯𝔳𝔢𝔡𝔅𝔬𝔩𝔡 for Green Chameleon. I think it's so cool to show a 3d effect in a landing page.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Like I said before, I particularly like Dark by 𝔅𝔢𝔰𝔱𝔖𝔢𝔯𝔳𝔢𝔡𝔅𝔬𝔩𝔡 for Green Chameleon. My favorite part of the website is the animation and the aesthetic they chose to make it look like a 
                                sci-fi security camera. I think their interface achieved their goal in a unique manner becuase they used typology to simulate a technological interface that you can use yourself like your controlling
                            the camera. They also make the cursor in a similar manner like it is a flashlight the user is controlling along with the character in the image. They also made the screen really accessible as it has text contrast to easily distinguish
                        the image and the text as well as make it user friendly with its limited options.  </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> On a scale from 1 to 10 i would give this article a 5 becuase at first I was confused on what to take away from the article. It was more of a showcase to display different websites rather than an article. 
                                I think if it were to explain why these designs are succesful and if they all show a similar theme it would educate me more about website design. </p>
