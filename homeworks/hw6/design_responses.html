						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article, I learned about all the animation principles that are important in user interface experience. One thing to takeaway from this article is that the speed of animations matter as it cannot be too fast for someone to process or too slow where someone can get bored. The animation should also be used intentionally where the movements feel natural and intuitive. The animations also should guide attention, improve visual hiearchy and enhance user experience instead of disrupting it.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite parth of the article was discussing the different kinds of animations there are and what each of their purposes were. Some were to guide attention while others were to show change and blend motion. they also showed examples of what good and bad design is.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "According to Material Design, when the moving objects transform their size disproportionally, they should move along the arc rather than in a straight line. It helps making the movement more natural." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article an 8 because of the detailed explanations of each animation and examples of good and bad cases of each one. I liked how it gave me an understanding in user experience and why animations matters as I would not have thought animation would matter that much beforehand. I think it expanded my knowledge and understanding in animation in interface design.  </p>
