							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about the Gestalt principles in UI design and how they can be applied to create more effective and impactful user interfaces. Specifically, I learned about principles such as proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity, and how they influence users' perception and interaction with digital interfaces. This also allows for individuals to group things together and understand what intuitive means for interfaces.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was learning about the Common Fate principle in Gestalt psychology and its application in UI design. The idea that elements moving together are perceived as more related is cool, and I found it interesting how this principle can be leveraged to guide user attention and interaction in digital interfaces. I think this is really important as an aspiring web designer/ui designer and I hope to apply these concepts in my final project. </p>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would rate my enjoyment of this article as an 8. The information provided was insightful and well-organized, making it easy to understand and apply the concepts discussed. However, I would have appreciated more examples illustrating how each Gestalt principle can be implemented in UI design throughout websites instead of just logo and branding examples. What about colors interacting with Gestalt principles? I think it would be really informative. </p>
