The article provided detailed explanations of various types of dark patterns and their potential impact on users and society such as bait and switch and misdirection. It highlighted the importance of ethical design practices and the need for transparency in UX design.

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "One of the examples of disguised ads that I found during my research is from Dafont.com (a free font download site). It disguises ads and misleads the users into clicking them... the main download button is much smaller and less visible than the download option for ZipMac, which has nothing to do with the font that the user would want to download." </p>
